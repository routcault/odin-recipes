    <p>By Alexander Stafford</p>

    <p>From Julia Tursehn's <em>Small Victories</em>, these Lentils
    come together in about 30 minutes, are deeply satisfying, and could be vegan if you leave out the yogurt(which we usually do).
    Naan is also really nice on the side here. Red lentils: I like to use a mix of French green lentils and red split lentils. It's
    faster if you use solely the red split lentials, but I love the texture offered by the French green ones when they're part of the mix.
    It's completely delicious both ways, so use what you have. Do plan a little bit more ahead if you use the French green lentils - they may
    take as long as 45 minutes to cook if not longer.

    <p> Serves 4</p>

    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp minced peeled fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 Shallot or small onion, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 Tsp cumin seeds or ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 Tsp ground tumeric</li>
        <li>1 Cup (180g) split red lentils or other (see notes above)</li>
        <li>1 13.5 ounce (398ml) can full-fat unsweetened coconut milk</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Cooked basmati rice, plain yogurt, chopped fresh cilantro, and naan for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the ginger, garlic, shallot (or onion),
            coriander, cumin, and tumeric and cook, stirring now and then, until the vegetables are softened 
            and the spices are very fragrant, about 10  minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the lentils, coconut milk, and 2 teaspoons kosher salt (<strong>Note:</strong> if you are sensitive to salt or using
        table salt, start with 1 teaspoon, then add more to taste), then fill the empty coconut-milk can with
        water and add it to the saucepan. It will look like a lot of liquid, but the lentils will absorb it as they cook.
        Stir everything together, turn the heat to high, and bring the mixture to a boil. Turn the heat to
        low and let the lentils simmer, stirring now and then, until they're completely soft, about 20 minutes.
        Season to taste with salt. (<strong>Note:</strong> If you're using those French green lentils, you will need to cook this
        longer, about 30 to 45 minutes. Just keep tasting to see when the lentils are cooked through. You may or may not
        need to add more water.)</li>
        <li>Serve the lentils hot over rice. Top each serving with a spoonful of yogurt and a sprinkle of cilantro.
            A side of naan is nice, too.</li>
    </ol>
