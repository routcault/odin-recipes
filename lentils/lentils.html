    <h1>Curried Lentils with Coconut Milk</h1>
    <p>By Alexandra Stafford</p>

    <p>From Julia Tursehn's <em>Small Victories</em>, these Lentils
    come together in about 30 minutes, are deeply satisfying, and could be vegan if you leave out the yogurt(which we usually do).
    Naan is also really nice on the side here. Red lentils: I like to use a mix of French green lentils and red split lentils. It's
    faster if you use solely the red split lentials, but I love the texture offered by the French green ones when they're part of the mix.
    It's completely delicious both ways, so use what you have. Do plan a little bit more ahead if you use the French green lentils - they may
    take as long as 45 minutes to cook if not longer.
