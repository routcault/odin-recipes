    <p>This is a breakfast burrito recipe I started during quarantine and have built upon every since. I hope you enjoy!</p>

    <p><em>Serves 1</em></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Large Tortilla</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Hummus</li>
        <li>2 Whole Eggs, scrambled</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp of Oil or Butter</li>
        <li>1/8 Cup of Shredded Cheese</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Hot Sauce(to taste)</li>
        <li>5 Grape Tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1/4 Avocado, sliced</li>
        <li>1 Frozen Hashbrown</li>
        <li>Pinch of Pamersan Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the butter in a small frying pan over medium heat. Once the butter is completely melted, crack and scramble both eggs in a bowl and pour into the frying pan.</li>
        <li>If you are using a frozen hashbrown or potatoes, now is the time to place in toaster oven or heat in separate pan.</li>
        <li>As the eggs cook for a bit over medium heat, add in the shredded cheese, halved tomatoes, salt, pepper, hot sauce to taste.</li>
        <li>Proceed to scramble the eggs to avoid burning. While the eggs are near the consistency you desire, heat the tortilla in the microwave for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Once the tortilla is done warming, spread the hummus in a small circle in the center of the tortilla. Careful not to get it too close to the edges or it will be not stick properly when it comes to closing the burrito.</li>
        <li>Then take the finished eggs and place in the center of the burrito. Top with pamersan cheese, avocado, hashbrown and hot sauce. </li>
        <li>Once all ingredients are on the tortilla, fold over one side of the tortilla just enough to cover the contents and touch down outside of the hummus area. Fold in the sides as much possible and continue to roll and fold until completely sealed.</li>
        <li>Place in a toaster oven on "Toaster" setting for a couple minutes or until you see the top become golden brown.</li>
        <li>Cut the burrito in half width wise and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
